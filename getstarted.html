        <h2>NEW YORK</h2>
        <p>
            New York City, known as "The City That Never Sleeps," is a vibrant melting pot of cultures and history. With iconic landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, and Times Square, it’s a global hub for finance, art, and fashion. The city’s five boroughs—Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island—each have their own distinct vibe. Famous for its skyline and landmarks like the Empire State Building, NYC is also home to world-class theaters, especially on Broadway. The subway system connects it all, while green spaces offer a break from the hustle and bustle.</p>
